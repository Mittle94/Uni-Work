<h3> <font color="White"> Thank you for taking to time to view my website as part of my Assignment. I have tried my best to do this whole project from scratch taking only what i've learnt from videos showing the basic instructions.
	I appreciate any and all feedback regarding what I can and could've done better as I feel it will help my understanding of the subject greatly. </h3>
